# Scraper_1

This app digs through the NY Times looking for news! It's fun, exciting, and full of nuts.

The news is very important. It informs people about what is going on in society. People can keep informed and make their own decisions about the news.

How users can get started with the project

This app is pretty self expainatary, Google or someother search engine would be a good place to help out if more information is desired.

This is a coding boot camp project, I have turned it in but it is a good idea to cross referance other instaces of #Scraper_1.
